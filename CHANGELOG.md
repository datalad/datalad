                                               Change Log

This is a high level and scarce summary of the changes between releases.
We would recommend to consult log of the 
[DataLad git repository](http://github.com/datalad/datalad) for more details.


## 0.11.4 (??? ??, 2019) -- will be better than ever

bet we will fix some bugs and make a world even a better place.

### Major refactoring and deprecations

- hopefully none

### Fixes

?

### Enhancements and new features

?


## 0.11.3 (Feb 19, 2019) -- read-me-gently

Just a few of important fixes and minor enhancements.

### Fixes

- The logic for setting the maximum command line length now works
  around Python 3.4 returning an unreasonably high value for
  `SC_ARG_MAX` on Debian systems. ([#3165])

- DataLad commands that are conceptually "read-only", such as
  `datalad ls -L`, can fail when the caller lacks write permissions
  because git-annex tries merging remote git-annex branches to update
  information about availability. DataLad now disables
  `annex.merge-annex-branches` in some common "read-only" scenarios to
  avoid these failures. ([#3164])

### Enhancements and new features

- Accessing an "unbound" dataset method now automatically imports the
  necessary module rather than requiring an explicit import from the
  Python caller. For example, calling `Dataset.add` no longer needs to
  be preceded by `from datalad.distribution.add import Add` or an
  import of `datalad.api`. ([#3156])

- Configuring the new variable `datalad.ssh.identityfile` instructs
  DataLad to pass a value to the `-i` option of `ssh`. ([#3149])
  ([#3168])

## 0.11.2 (Feb 07, 2019) -- live-long-and-prosper

A variety of bugfixes and enhancements

### Major refactoring and deprecations

- All extracted metadata is now placed under git-annex by default.
  Previously files smaller than 20 kb were stored in git. ([#3109])
- The function `datalad.cmd.get_runner` has been removed. ([#3104])

### Fixes

- Improved handling of long commands:
  - The code that inspected `SC_ARG_MAX` didn't check that the
    reported value was a sensible, positive number. ([#3025])
  - More commands that invoke `git` and `git-annex` with file
    arguments learned to split up the command calls when it is likely
    that the command would fail due to exceeding the maximum supported
    length. ([#3138])
- The `setup_yoda_dataset` procedure created a malformed
  .gitattributes line. ([#3057])
- [download-url] unnecessarily tried to infer the dataset when
  `--no-save` was given. ([#3029])
- [rerun] aborted too late and with a confusing message when a ref
  specified via `--onto` didn't exist. ([#3019])
- [run]:
  - `run` didn't preserve the current directory prefix ("./") on
     inputs and outputs, which is problematic if the caller relies on
     this representation when formatting the command. ([#3037])
  - Fixed a number of unicode py2-compatibility issues. ([#3035]) ([#3046])
  - To proceed with a failed command, the user was confusingly
    instructed to use `save` instead of `add` even though `run` uses
    `add` underneath. ([#3080])
- Fixed a case where the helper class for checking external modules
  incorrectly reported a module as unknown. ([#3051])
- [add-archive-content] mishandled the archive path when the leading
  path contained a symlink. ([#3058])
- Following denied access, the credential code failed to consider a
  scenario, leading to a type error rather than an appropriate error
  message. ([#3091])
- Some tests failed when executed from a `git worktree` checkout of the
  source repository. ([#3129])
- During metadata extraction, batched annex processes weren't properly
  terminated, leading to issues on Windows. ([#3137])
- [add] incorrectly handled an "invalid repository" exception when
  trying to add a submodule. ([#3141])
- Pass `GIT_SSH_VARIANT=ssh` to git processes to be able to specify
  alternative ports in SSH urls

### Enhancements and new features

- [search] learned to suggest closely matching keys if there are no
  hits. ([#3089])
- [create-sibling]
  - gained a `--group` option so that the caller can specify the file
    system group for the repository. ([#3098])
  - now understands SSH URLs that have a port in them (i.e. the
    "ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/" syntax mentioned
    in `man git-fetch`). ([#3146])
- Interface classes can now override the default renderer for
  summarizing results. ([#3061])
- [run]:
  - `--input` and `--output` can now be shortened to `-i` and `-o`.
    ([#3066])
  - Placeholders such as "{inputs}" are now expanded in the command
    that is shown in the commit message subject. ([#3065])
  - `interface.run.run_command` gained an `extra_inputs` argument so
    that wrappers like [datalad-container] can specify additional inputs
    that aren't considered when formatting the command string. ([#3038])
  - "--" can now be used to separate options for `run` and those for
    the command in ambiguous cases. ([#3119])
- The utilities `create_tree` and `ok_file_has_content` now support
  ".gz" files. ([#3049])
- The Singularity container for 0.11.1 now uses [nd_freeze] to make
  its builds reproducible.
- A [publications] page has been added to the documentation. ([#3099])
- `GitRepo.set_gitattributes` now accepts a `mode` argument that
  controls whether the .gitattributes file is appended to (default) or
  overwritten. ([#3115])
- `datalad --help` now avoids using `man` so that the list of
  subcommands is shown.  ([#3124])

## 0.11.1 (Nov 26, 2018) -- v7-better-than-v6

Rushed out bugfix release to stay fully compatible with recent
[git-annex] which introduced v7 to replace v6.

### Fixes

- [install]: be able to install recursively into a dataset ([#2982])
- [save]: be able to commit/save changes whenever files potentially
  could have swapped their storage between git and annex
  ([#1651]) ([#2752]) ([#3009])
- [aggregate-metadata]:
  - dataset's itself is now not "aggregated" if specific paths are
    provided for aggregation ([#3002]). That resolves the issue of
    `-r` invocation aggregating all subdatasets of the specified dataset
    as well
  - also compare/verify the actual content checksum of aggregated metadata
    while considering subdataset metadata for re-aggregation ([#3007])
- `annex` commands are now chunked assuming 50% "safety margin" on the
  maximal command line length. Should resolve crashes while operating
  ot too many files at ones ([#3001])
- `run` sidecar config processing ([#2991])
- no double trailing period in docs ([#2984])
- correct identification of the repository with symlinks in the paths
  in the tests ([#2972])
- re-evaluation of dataset properties in case of dataset changes ([#2946])
- [text2git] procedure to use `ds.repo.set_gitattributes`
  ([#2974]) ([#2954])
- Switch to use plain `os.getcwd()` if inconsistency with env var
  `$PWD` is detected ([#2914])
- Make sure that credential defined in env var takes precedence
  ([#2960]) ([#2950])

### Enhancements and new features

- [shub://datalad/datalad:git-annex-dev](https://singularity-hub.org/containers/5663/view)
  provides a Debian buster Singularity image with build environment for
  [git-annex]. [tools/bisect-git-annex]() provides a helper for running
  `git bisect` on git-annex using that Singularity container ([#2995])
- Added [.zenodo.json]() for better integration with Zenodo for citation
- [run-procedure] now provides names and help messages with a custom
  renderer for ([#2993])
- Documentation: point to [datalad-revolution] extension (prototype of
  the greater DataLad future)
- [run]
  - support injecting of a detached command ([#2937])
- `annex` metadata extractor now extracts `annex.key` metadata record.
  Should allow now to identify uses of specific files etc ([#2952])
- Test that we can install from http://datasets.datalad.org
- Proper rendering of `CommandError` (e.g. in case of "out of space"
  error) ([#2958])


## 0.11.0 (Oct 23, 2018) -- Soon-to-be-perfect

[git-annex] 6.20180913 (or later) is now required - provides a number of
fixes for v6 mode operations etc.

### Major refactoring and deprecations

- `datalad.consts.LOCAL_CENTRAL_PATH` constant was deprecated in favor
  of `datalad.locations.default-dataset` [configuration] variable
  ([#2835])

### Minor refactoring

- `"notneeded"` messages are no longer reported by default results
  renderer
- [run] no longer shows commit instructions upon command failure when
  `explicit` is true and no outputs are specified ([#2922])
- `get_git_dir` moved into GitRepo ([#2886])
- `_gitpy_custom_call` removed from GitRepo ([#2894])
- `GitRepo.get_merge_base` argument is now called `commitishes` instead
  of `treeishes` ([#2903])

### Fixes

- [update] should not leave the dataset in non-clean state ([#2858])
  and some other enhancements ([#2859])
- Fixed chunking of the long command lines to account for decorators
  and other arguments ([#2864])
- Progress bar should not crash the process on some missing progress
  information ([#2891])
- Default value for `jobs` set to be `"auto"` (not `None`) to take
  advantage of possible parallel get if in `-g` mode ([#2861])
- [wtf] must not crash if `git-annex` is not installed etc ([#2865]),
  ([#2865]), ([#2918]), ([#2917])
- Fixed paths (with spaces etc) handling while reporting annex error
  output ([#2892]), ([#2893])
- `__del__` should not access `.repo` but `._repo` to avoid attempts
  for reinstantiation etc ([#2901])
- Fix up submodule `.git` right in `GitRepo.add_submodule` to avoid
  added submodules being non git-annex friendly ([#2909]), ([#2904])
- [run-procedure] ([#2905])
  - now will provide dataset into the procedure if called within dataset
  - will not crash if procedure is an executable without `.py` or `.sh`
    suffixes
- Use centralized `.gitattributes` handling while setting annex backend
  ([#2912])
- `GlobbedPaths.expand(..., full=True)` incorrectly returned relative
   paths when called more than once ([#2921])

### Enhancements and new features

- Report progress on [clone] when installing from "smart" git servers
  ([#2876])
- Stale/unused `sth_like_file_has_content` was removed ([#2860])
- Enhancements to [search] to operate on "improved" metadata layouts
  ([#2878])
- Output of `git annex init` operation is now logged ([#2881])
- New
  - `GitRepo.cherry_pick` ([#2900])
  - `GitRepo.format_commit` ([#2902])
- [run-procedure] ([#2905])
  - procedures can now recursively be discovered in subdatasets as well.
    The uppermost has highest priority
  - Procedures in user and system locations now take precedence over
    those in datasets.

## 0.10.3.1 (Sep 13, 2018) -- Nothing-is-perfect

Emergency bugfix to address forgotten boost of version in
`datalad/version.py`.

## 0.10.3 (Sep 13, 2018) -- Almost-perfect

This is largely a bugfix release which addressed many (but not yet all)
issues of working with git-annex direct and version 6 modes, and operation
on Windows in general.  Among enhancements you will see the
support of public S3 buckets (even with periods in their names),
ability to configure new providers interactively, and improved `egrep`
search backend.

Although we do not require with this release, it is recommended to make
sure that you are using a recent `git-annex` since it also had a variety
of fixes and enhancements in the past months.

### Fixes

- Parsing of combined short options has been broken since DataLad
  v0.10.0. ([#2710])
- The `datalad save` instructions shown by `datalad run` for a command
  with a non-zero exit were incorrectly formatted. ([#2692])
- Decompression of zip files (e.g., through `datalad
  add-archive-content`) failed on Python 3.  ([#2702])
- Windows:
  - colored log output was not being processed by colorama.  ([#2707])
  - more codepaths now try multiple times when removing a file to deal
    with latency and locking issues on Windows.  ([#2795])
- Internal git fetch calls have been updated to work around a
  GitPython `BadName` issue.  ([#2712]), ([#2794])
- The progess bar for annex file transferring was unable to handle an
  empty file.  ([#2717])
- `datalad add-readme` halted when no aggregated metadata was found
  rather than displaying a warning.  ([#2731])
- `datalad rerun` failed if `--onto` was specified and the history
  contained no run commits.  ([#2761])
- Processing of a command's results failed on a result record with a
  missing value (e.g., absent field or subfield in metadata).  Now the
  missing value is rendered as "N/A".  ([#2725]).
- A couple of documentation links in the "Delineation from related
  solutions" were misformatted.  ([#2773])
- With the latest git-annex, several known V6 failures are no longer
  an issue.  ([#2777])
- In direct mode, commit changes would often commit annexed content as
  regular Git files.  A new approach fixes this and resolves a good
  number of known failures.  ([#2770])
- The reporting of command results failed if the current working
  directory was removed (e.g., after an unsuccessful `install`). ([#2788])
- When installing into an existing empty directory, `datalad install`
  removed the directory after a failed clone.  ([#2788])
- `datalad run` incorrectly handled inputs and outputs for paths with
  spaces and other characters that require shell escaping.  ([#2798])
- Globbing inputs and outputs for `datalad run` didn't work correctly
  if a subdataset wasn't installed.  ([#2796])
- Minor (in)compatibility with git 2.19 - (no) trailing period
  in an error message now. ([#2815])

### Enhancements and new features

- Anonymous access is now supported for S3 and other downloaders.  ([#2708])
- A new interface is available to ease setting up new providers.  ([#2708])
- Metadata: changes to egrep mode search  ([#2735])
  - Queries in egrep mode are now case-sensitive when the query
    contains any uppercase letters and are case-insensitive otherwise.
    The new mode egrepcs can be used to perform a case-sensitive query
    with all lower-case letters.
  - Search can now be limited to a specific key.
  - Multiple queries (list of expressions) are evaluated using AND to
    determine whether something is a hit.
  - A single multi-field query (e.g., `pa*:findme`) is a hit, when any
    matching field matches the query.
  - All matching key/value combinations across all (multi-field)
    queries are reported in the query_matched result field.
  - egrep mode now shows all hits rather than limiting the results to
    the top 20 hits.
- The documentation on how to format commands for `datalad run` has
  been improved.  ([#2703])
- The method for determining the current working directory on Windows
  has been improved.  ([#2707])
- `datalad --version` now simply shows the version without the
  license.  ([#2733])
- `datalad export-archive` learned to export under an existing
  directory via its `--filename` option.  ([#2723])
- `datalad export-to-figshare` now generates the zip archive in the
  root of the dataset unless `--filename` is specified.  ([#2723])
- After importing `datalad.api`, `help(datalad.api)` (or
  `datalad.api?` in IPython) now shows a summary of the available
  DataLad commands.  ([#2728])
- Support for using `datalad` from IPython has been improved.  ([#2722])
- `datalad wtf` now returns structured data and reports the version of
  each extension.  ([#2741])
- The internal handling of gitattributes information has been
  improved.  A user-visible consequence is that `datalad create
  --force` no longer duplicates existing attributes.  ([#2744])
- The "annex" metadata extractor can now be used even when no content
  is present.  ([#2724])
- The `add_url_to_file` method (called by commands like `datalad
  download-url` and `datalad add-archive-content`) learned how to
  display a progress bar.  ([#2738])


## 0.10.2 (Jul 09, 2018) -- Thesecuriestever

Primarily a bugfix release to accommodate recent git-annex release
forbidding file:// and http://localhost/ URLs which might lead to
revealing private files if annex is publicly shared.

### Fixes

- fixed testing to be compatible with recent git-annex (6.20180626)
- [download-url] will now download to current directory instead of the
  top of the dataset

### Enhancements and new features

- do not quote ~ in URLs to be consistent with quote implementation in
  Python 3.7 which now follows RFC 3986
- [run] support for user-configured placeholder values
- documentation on native git-annex metadata support
- handle 401 errors from LORIS tokens
- `yoda` procedure will instantiate `README.md`
- `--discover` option added to [run-procedure] to list available
  procedures

## 0.10.1 (Jun 17, 2018) -- OHBM polish

The is a minor bugfix release.

### Fixes

- Be able to use backports.lzma as a drop-in replacement for pyliblzma.
- Give help when not specifying a procedure name in `run-procedure`.
- Abort early when a downloader received no filename.
- Avoid `rerun` error when trying to unlock non-available files.

## 0.10.0 (Jun 09, 2018) -- The Release

This release is a major leap forward in metadata support.

### Major refactoring and deprecations

- Metadata
  - Prior metadata provided by datasets under `.datalad/meta` is no
    longer used or supported. Metadata must be reaggregated using 0.10
    version
  - Metadata extractor types are no longer auto-guessed and must be
    explicitly specified in `datalad.metadata.nativetype` config
    (could contain multiple values)
  - Metadata aggregation of a dataset hierarchy no longer updates all
    datasets in the tree with new metadata. Instead, only the target
    dataset is updated. This behavior can be changed via the --update-mode
    switch. The new default prevents needless modification of (3rd-party)
    subdatasets.
  - Neuroimaging metadata support has been moved into a dedicated extension:
    https://github.com/datalad/datalad-neuroimaging
- Crawler
  - moved into a dedicated extension:
    https://github.com/datalad/datalad-crawler
- `export_tarball` plugin has been generalized to `export_archive` and
  can now also generate ZIP archives.
- By default a dataset X is now only considered to be a super-dataset of
  another dataset Y, if Y is also a registered subdataset of X.

### Fixes

A number of fixes did not make it into the 0.9.x series:

- Dynamic configuration overrides via the `-c` option were not in effect.
- `save` is now more robust with respect to invocation in subdirectories
  of a dataset.
- `unlock` now reports correct paths when running in a dataset subdirectory.
- `get` is more robust to path that contain symbolic links.
- symlinks to subdatasets of a dataset are now correctly treated as a symlink,
  and not as a subdataset
- `add` now correctly saves staged subdataset additions.
- Running `datalad save` in a dataset no longer adds untracked content to the
  dataset. In order to add content a path has to be given, e.g. `datalad save .`
- `wtf` now works reliably with a DataLad that wasn't installed from Git (but,
  e.g., via pip)
- More robust URL handling in `simple_with_archives` crawler pipeline.

### Enhancements and new features

- Support for DataLad extension that can contribute API components from 3rd-party sources,
  incl. commands, metadata extractors, and test case implementations.
  See https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extension-template for a demo extension.
- Metadata (everything has changed!)
  - Metadata extraction and aggregation is now supported for datasets and individual
    files.
  - Metadata query via `search` can now discover individual files.
  - Extracted metadata can now be stored in XZ compressed files, is optionally
    annexed (when exceeding a configurable size threshold), and obtained on
    demand (new configuration option `datalad.metadata.create-aggregate-annex-limit`).
  - Status and availability of aggregated metadata can now be reported via
    `metadata --get-aggregates`
  - New configuration option `datalad.metadata.maxfieldsize` to exclude too large
    metadata fields from aggregation.
  - The type of metadata is no longer guessed during metadata extraction. A new
    configuration option `datalad.metadata.nativetype` was introduced to enable
    one or more particular metadata extractors for a dataset.
  - New configuration option `datalad.metadata.store-aggregate-content` to enable
    the storage of aggregated metadata for dataset content (i.e. file-based metadata)
    in contrast to just metadata describing a dataset as a whole.
- `search` was completely reimplemented. It offers three different modes now:
  - 'egrep' (default): expression matching in a plain string version of metadata
  - 'textblob': search a text version of all metadata using a fully featured
     query language (fast indexing, good for keyword search)
  - 'autofield': search an auto-generated index that preserves individual fields
     of metadata that can be represented in a tabular structure (substantial
     indexing cost, enables the most detailed queries of all modes)
- New extensions:
  - addurls, an extension for creating a dataset (and possibly subdatasets)
    from a list of URLs.
  - export_to_figshare
  - extract_metadata
- add_readme makes use of available metadata
- By default the wtf extension now hides sensitive information, which can be
  included in the output by passing `--senstive=some` or `--senstive=all`.
- Reduced startup latency by only importing commands necessary for a particular
  command line call.
- `datalad create -d <parent> --nosave` now registers subdatasets, when possible.
- `datalad run` now provides a way for the caller to save the result when a
  command has a non-zero exit status.
- `datalad rerun` now has a `--script` option that can be used to extract
  previous commands into a file.
- A DataLad Singularity container is now available on
  [Singularity Hub](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/667).
- More casts have been embedded in the [use case section of the documentation](http://docs.datalad.org/en/docs/usecases/index.html).
- `datalad --report-status` has a new value 'all' that can be used to
  temporarily re-enable reporting that was disable by configuration settings.


## 0.9.3 (Mar 16, 2018) -- pi+0.02 release

Some important bug fixes which should improve usability

### Fixes

- `datalad-archives` special remote now will lock on acquiring or
  extracting an archive - this allows for it to be used with -J flag
  for parallel operation
- relax introduced in 0.9.2 demand on git being configured for datalad
  operation - now we will just issue a warning
- `datalad ls` should now list "authored date" and work also for datasets
  in detached HEAD mode
- `datalad save` will now save original file as well, if file was
  "git mv"ed, so you can now `datalad run git mv old new` and have
  changes recorded

### Enhancements and new features

- `--jobs` argument now could take `auto` value which would decide on
  # of jobs depending on the # of available CPUs.
  `git-annex` > 6.20180314 is recommended to avoid regression with -J.
- memoize calls to `RI` meta-constructor -- should speed up operation a
  bit
- `DATALAD_SEED` environment variable could be used to seed Python RNG
  and provide reproducible UUIDs etc (useful for testing and demos)


## 0.9.2 (Mar 04, 2018) -- it is (again) better than ever

Largely a bugfix release with a few enhancements.

### Fixes

- Execution of external commands (git) should not get stuck when
  lots of both stdout and stderr output, and should not loose remaining
  output in some cases
- Config overrides provided in the command line (-c) should now be
  handled correctly
- Consider more remotes (not just tracking one, which might be none)
  while installing subdatasets
- Compatibility with git 2.16 with some changed behaviors/annotations
  for submodules
- Fail `remove` if `annex drop` failed
- Do not fail operating on files which start with dash (-)
- URL unquote paths within S3, URLs and DataLad RIs (///)
- In non-interactive mode fail if authentication/access fails
- Web UI:
  - refactored a little to fix incorrect listing of submodules in
    subdirectories
  - now auto-focuses on search edit box upon entering the page
- Assure that extracted from tarballs directories have executable bit set

### Enhancements and new features

- A log message and progress bar will now inform if a tarball to be
  downloaded while getting specific files
  (requires git-annex > 6.20180206)
- A dedicated `datalad rerun` command capable of rerunning entire
  sequences of previously `run` commands.
  **Reproducibility through VCS. Use `run` even if not interested in `rerun`**
- Alert the user if `git` is not yet configured but git operations
  are requested
- Delay collection of previous ssh connections until it is actually
  needed.  Also do not require ':' while specifying ssh host
- AutomagicIO: Added proxying of isfile, lzma.LZMAFile and io.open
- Testing:
  - added DATALAD_DATASETS_TOPURL=http://datasets-tests.datalad.org to
    run tests against another website to not obscure access stats
  - tests run against temporary HOME to avoid side-effects
  - better unit-testing of interactions with special remotes
- CONTRIBUTING.md describes how to setup and use `git-hub` tool to
  "attach" commits to an issue making it into a PR
- DATALAD_USE_DEFAULT_GIT env variable could be used to cause DataLad
  to use default (not the one possibly bundled with git-annex) git
- Be more robust while handling not supported requests by annex in
  special remotes
- Use of `swallow_logs` in the code was refactored away -- less
  mysteries now, just increase logging level
- `wtf` plugin will report more information about environment, externals
  and the system


## 0.9.1 (Oct 01, 2017) -- "DATALAD!"(JBTM)

Minor bugfix release

### Fixes

- Should work correctly with subdatasets named as numbers of bool
  values (requires also GitPython >= 2.1.6)
- Custom special remotes should work without crashing with 
  git-annex >= 6.20170924


## 0.9.0 (Sep 19, 2017) -- isn't it a lucky day even though not a Friday?

### Major refactoring and deprecations

- the `files` argument of [save] has been renamed to `path` to be uniform with
  any other command
- all major commands now implement more uniform API semantics and result reporting.
  Functionality for modification detection of dataset content has been completely replaced
  with a more efficient implementation
- [publish] now features a `--transfer-data` switch that allows for a
  disambiguous specification of whether to publish data -- independent of
  the selection which datasets to publish (which is done via their paths).
  Moreover, [publish] now transfers data before repository content is pushed.

### Fixes

- [drop] no longer errors when some subdatasets are not installed
- [install] will no longer report nothing when a Dataset instance was
  given as a source argument, but rather perform as expected
- [remove] doesn't remove when some files of a dataset could not be dropped
- [publish] 
  - no longer hides error during a repository push
  - publish behaves "correctly" for `--since=` in considering only the
    differences the last "pushed" state
  - data transfer handling while publishing with dependencies, to github
- improved robustness with broken Git configuration
- [search] should search for unicode strings correctly and not crash
- robustify git-annex special remotes protocol handling to allow for spaces in
  the last argument
- UI credentials interface should now allow to Ctrl-C the entry
- should not fail while operating on submodules named with
  numerics only or by bool (true/false) names
- [crawl] templates should not now override settings for `largefiles` if 
  specified in `.gitattributes`


### Enhancements and new features

- **Exciting new feature** [run] command to protocol execution of an external 
  command and rerun computation if desired. 
  See [screencast](http://datalad.org/features.html#reproducible-science)
- [save] now uses Git for detecting with sundatasets need to be inspected for
  potential changes, instead of performing a complete traversal of a dataset tree
- [add] looks for changes relative to the last commited state of a dataset
  to discover files to add more efficiently
- [diff] can now report untracked files in addition to modified files
- [uninstall] will check itself whether a subdataset is properly registered in a
  superdataset, even when no superdataset is given in a call
- [subdatasets] can now configure subdatasets for exclusion from recursive
  installation (`datalad-recursiveinstall` submodule configuration property)
- precrafted pipelines of [crawl] now will not override `annex.largefiles`
  setting if any was set within `.gitattribues` (e.g. by `datalad create --text-no-annex`)
- framework for screencasts: `tools/cast*` tools and sample cast scripts under
  `doc/casts` which are published at [datalad.org/features.html](http://datalad.org/features.html)
- new [project YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB8-Zf7D0DSzAsREoIt0Bvw) 
- tests failing in direct and/or v6 modes marked explicitly

## 0.8.1 (Aug 13, 2017) -- the best birthday gift

Bugfixes

### Fixes

- Do not attempt to [update] a not installed sub-dataset
- In case of too many files to be specified for [get] or [copy_to], we
  will make multiple invocations of underlying git-annex command to not
  overfill command line
- More robust handling of unicode output in terminals which might not support it

### Enhancements and new features

- Ship a copy of numpy.testing to facilitate [test] without requiring numpy
  as dependency. Also allow to pass to command which test(s) to run
- In [get] and [copy_to] provide actual original requested paths, not the
  ones we deduced need to be transferred, solely for knowing the total


## 0.8.0 (Jul 31, 2017) -- it is better than ever

A variety of fixes and enhancements

### Fixes

- [publish] would now push merged `git-annex` branch even if no other changes
  were done
- [publish] should be able to publish using relative path within SSH URI
  (git hook would use relative paths)
- [publish] should better tollerate publishing to pure git and `git-annex` 
  special remotes 

### Enhancements and new features

- [plugin] mechanism came to replace [export]. See [export_tarball] for the
  replacement of [export].  Now it should be easy to extend datalad's interface
  with custom functionality to be invoked along with other commands.
- Minimalistic coloring of the results rendering
- [publish]/`copy_to` got progress bar report now and support of `--jobs`
- minor fixes and enhancements to crawler (e.g. support of recursive removes)


## 0.7.0 (Jun 25, 2017) -- when it works - it is quite awesome!

New features, refactorings, and bug fixes.

### Major refactoring and deprecations

- [add-sibling] has been fully replaced by the [siblings] command
- [create-sibling], and [unlock] have been re-written to support the
  same common API as most other commands

### Enhancements and new features

- [siblings] can now be used to query and configure a local repository by
  using the sibling name ``here``
- [siblings] can now query and set annex preferred content configuration. This
  includes ``wanted`` (as previously supported in other commands), and now
  also ``required``
- New [metadata] command to interface with datasets/files [meta-data] 
- Documentation for all commands is now built in a uniform fashion
- Significant parts of the documentation of been updated
- Instantiate GitPython's Repo instances lazily

### Fixes

- API documentation is now rendered properly as HTML, and is easier to browse by
  having more compact pages
- Closed files left open on various occasions (Popen PIPEs, etc)
- Restored basic (consumer mode of operation) compatibility with Windows OS 


## 0.6.0 (Jun 14, 2017) -- German perfectionism

This release includes a **huge** refactoring to make code base and functionality
more robust and flexible

- outputs from API commands could now be highly customized.  See
  `--output-format`, `--report-status`, `--report-type`, and `--report-type`
  options for [datalad] command.
- effort was made to refactor code base so that underlying functions behave as
  generators where possible
- input paths/arguments analysis was redone for majority of the commands to provide
  unified behavior

### Major refactoring and deprecations

- `add-sibling` and `rewrite-urls` were refactored in favor of new [siblings]
  command which should be used for siblings manipulations
- 'datalad.api.alwaysrender' config setting/support is removed in favor of new
  outputs processing

### Fixes

- Do not flush manually git index in pre-commit to avoid "Death by the Lock" issue
- Deployed by [publish] `post-update` hook script now should be more robust
  (tolerate directory names with spaces, etc.)
- A variety of fixes, see
  [list of pull requests and issues closed](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/milestone/41?closed=1)
  for more information

### Enhancements and new features

- new [annotate-paths] plumbing command to inspect and annotate provided
  paths.  Use `--modified` to summarize changes between different points in
  the history
- new [clone] plumbing command to provide a subset (install a single dataset
  from a URL) functionality of [install]
- new [diff] plumbing command
- new [siblings] command to list or manipulate siblings
- new [subdatasets] command to list subdatasets and their properties
- [drop] and [remove] commands were refactored
- `benchmarks/` collection of [Airspeed velocity](https://github.com/spacetelescope/asv/)
  benchmarks initiated.  See reports at http://datalad.github.io/datalad/
- crawler would try to download a new url multiple times increasing delay between
  attempts.  Helps to resolve problems with extended crawls of Amazon S3
- [CRCNS] crawler pipeline now also fetches and aggregates meta-data for the
  datasets from datacite
- overall optimisations to benefit from the aforementioned refactoring and
  improve user-experience
- a few stub and not (yet) implemented commands (e.g. `move`) were removed from
  the interface
- Web frontend got proper coloring for the breadcrumbs and some additional
  caching to speed up interactions.  See http://datasets.datalad.org
- Small improvements to the online documentation.  See e.g.
  [summary of differences between git/git-annex/datalad](http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/related.html#git-git-annex-datalad)

## 0.5.1 (Mar 25, 2017) -- cannot stop the progress

A bugfix release

### Fixes

- [add] was forcing addition of files to annex regardless of settings
  in `.gitattributes`.  Now that decision is left to annex by default
- `tools/testing/run_doc_examples` used to run
  doc examples as tests, fixed up to provide status per each example
  and not fail at once
- `doc/examples`
  - [3rdparty_analysis_workflow.sh](http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/examples/3rdparty_analysis_workflow.html)
    was fixed up to reflect changes in the API of 0.5.0.
- progress bars
  - should no longer crash **datalad** and report correct sizes and speeds
  - should provide progress reports while using Python 3.x

### Enhancements and new features

- `doc/examples`
  - [nipype_workshop_dataset.sh](http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/examples/nipype_workshop_dataset.html)
    new example to demonstrate how new super- and sub- datasets were established
    as a part of our datasets collection


## 0.5.0 (Mar 20, 2017) -- it's huge

This release includes an avalanche of bug fixes, enhancements, and
additions which at large should stay consistent with previous behavior
but provide better functioning.  Lots of code was refactored to provide
more consistent code-base, and some API breakage has happened.  Further
work is ongoing to standardize output and results reporting
([#1350])

### Most notable changes

- requires [git-annex] >= 6.20161210 (or better even >= 6.20161210 for
  improved functionality)
- commands should now operate on paths specified (if any), without
  causing side-effects on other dirty/staged files
- [save]
    - `-a` is deprecated in favor of `-u` or `--all-updates`
      so only changes known components get saved, and no new files
      automagically added
    - `-S` does no longer store the originating dataset in its commit
       message
- [add]
    - can specify commit/save message with `-m`
- [add-sibling] and [create-sibling]
    - now take the name of the sibling (remote) as a `-s` (`--name`)
      option, not a positional argument
    - `--publish-depends` to setup publishing data and code to multiple
      repositories (e.g. github + webserve) should now be functional
      see [this comment](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/335#issuecomment-277240733)
    - got `--publish-by-default` to specify what refs should be published
      by default
    - got `--annex-wanted`, `--annex-groupwanted` and `--annex-group`
      settings which would be used to instruct annex about preferred
      content. [publish] then will publish data using those settings if
      `wanted` is set.
    - got `--inherit` option to automagically figure out url/wanted and
      other git/annex settings for new remote sub-dataset to be constructed
- [publish]
    - got `--skip-failing` refactored into `--missing` option
      which could use new feature of [create-sibling] `--inherit`

### Fixes

- More consistent interaction through ssh - all ssh connections go
  through [sshrun] shim for a "single point of authentication", etc.
- More robust [ls] operation outside of the datasets
- A number of fixes for direct and v6 mode of annex

### Enhancements and new features

- New [drop] and [remove] commands
- [clean]
    - got `--what` to specify explicitly what cleaning steps to perform
      and now could be invoked with `-r`
- `datalad` and `git-annex-remote*` scripts now do not use setuptools
  entry points mechanism and rely on simple import to shorten start up time
- [Dataset] is also now using [Flyweight pattern], so the same instance is
  reused for the same dataset
- progressbars should not add more empty lines

### Internal refactoring

- Majority of the commands now go through `_prep` for arguments validation
  and pre-processing to avoid recursive invocations


## 0.4.1 (Nov 10, 2016) -- CA release

Requires now GitPython >= 2.1.0

### Fixes

- [save]
     - to not save staged files if explicit paths were provided
- improved (but not yet complete) support for direct mode
- [update] to not crash if some sub-datasets are not installed
- do not log calls to `git config` to avoid leakage of possibly 
  sensitive settings to the logs

### Enhancements and new features

- New [rfc822-compliant metadata] format
- [save]
    - -S to save the change also within all super-datasets
- [add] now has progress-bar reporting
- [create-sibling-github] to create a :term:`sibling` of a dataset on
  github
- [OpenfMRI] crawler and datasets were enriched with URLs to separate
  files where also available from openfmri s3 bucket
  (if upgrading your datalad datasets, you might need to run
  `git annex enableremote datalad` to make them available)
- various enhancements to log messages
- web interface
    - populates "install" box first thus making UX better over slower
      connections


## 0.4 (Oct 22, 2016) -- Paris is waiting

Primarily it is a bugfix release but because of significant refactoring
of the [install] and [get] implementation, it gets a new minor release. 

### Fixes

- be able to [get] or [install] while providing paths while being 
  outside of a dataset
- remote annex datasets get properly initialized
- robust detection of outdated [git-annex]

### Enhancements and new features

- interface changes
    - [get] `--recursion-limit=existing` to not recurse into not-installed
       subdatasets
    - [get] `-n` to possibly install sub-datasets without getting any data
    - [install] `--jobs|-J` to specify number of parallel jobs for annex 
      [get] call could use (ATM would not work when data comes from archives)
- more (unit-)testing
- documentation: see http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/basics.html
  for basic principles and useful shortcuts in referring to datasets
- various webface improvements:  breadcrumb paths, instructions how
  to install dataset, show version from the tags, etc.

## 0.3.1 (Oct 1, 2016) -- what a wonderful week

Primarily bugfixes but also a number of enhancements and core
refactorings

### Fixes

- do not build manpages and examples during installation to avoid
  problems with possibly previously outdated dependencies
- [install] can be called on already installed dataset (with `-r` or
  `-g`)

### Enhancements and new features

- complete overhaul of datalad configuration settings handling
  (see [Configuration documentation]), so majority of the environment.
  Now uses git format and stores persistent configuration settings under
  `.datalad/config` and local within `.git/config`
  variables we have used were renamed to match configuration names
- [create-sibling] does not now by default upload web front-end
- [export] command with a plug-in interface and `tarball` plugin to export
  datasets
- in Python, `.api` functions with rendering of results in command line
  got a _-suffixed sibling, which would render results as well in Python
  as well (e.g., using `search_` instead of `search` would also render
  results, not only output them back as Python objects)
- [get]
    - `--jobs` option (passed to `annex get`) for parallel downloads
    - total and per-download (with git-annex >= 6.20160923) progress bars
      (note that if content is to be obtained from an archive, no progress
      will be reported yet)
- [install] `--reckless` mode option
- [search]
    - highlights locations and fieldmaps for better readability
    - supports `-d^` or `-d///` to point to top-most or centrally
      installed meta-datasets
    - "complete" paths to the datasets are reported now
    - `-s` option to specify which fields (only) to search
- various enhancements and small fixes to [meta-data] handling, [ls],
  custom remotes, code-base formatting, downloaders, etc
- completely switched to `tqdm` library (`progressbar` is no longer
  used/supported)


## 0.3 (Sep 23, 2016) -- winter is coming

Lots of everything, including but not limited to

- enhanced index viewer, as the one on http://datasets.datalad.org
- initial new data providers support: [Kaggle], [BALSA], [NDA], [NITRC]
- initial [meta-data support and management]
- new and/or improved crawler pipelines for [BALSA], [CRCNS], [OpenfMRI]
- refactored [install] command, now with separate [get]
- some other commands renaming/refactoring (e.g., [create-sibling])
- datalad [search] would give you an option to install datalad's 
  super-dataset under ~/datalad if ran outside of a dataset

### 0.2.3 (Jun 28, 2016) -- busy OHBM

New features and bugfix release

- support of /// urls to point to http://datasets.datalad.org
- variety of fixes and enhancements throughout

### 0.2.2 (Jun 20, 2016) -- OHBM we are coming!
