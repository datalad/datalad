This is a very high level and scarce summary of the changes between releases.
We would recommend to consult log of the [DataLad git repository](http://github.com/datalad/datalad)
for more details ATM.

## 0.3.1 (Oct 1, 2016) -- what a wonderful week

Primarily bugfixes but also a number of enhancements and core
refactorings

### Fixes

- do not build manpages and examples during installation to avoid
  problems with possibly previously outdated dependencies
- [install] can be called on already installed dataset (with `-r` or
  `-g`)

### Enhancements and new features

- complete overhaul of datalad configuration settings handling
  (see [Configuration documentation]), so majority of the environment.
  Now uses git format and stores persistent configuration settings under
  `.datalad/config` and local within `.git/config`
  variables we have used were renamed to match configuration names
- [create-sibling] does not now by default upload web front-end
- [export] command with a plug-in interface and `tarball` plugin to export
  datasets
- in Python, `.api` functions with rendering of results in command line
  got a _-suffixed sibling, which would render results as well in Python
  as well (e.g., using `search_` instead of `search` would also render
  results, not only output them back as Python objects)
- [get]
    - `--jobs` option (passed to `annex get`) for parallel downloads
    - total and per-download (with git-annex >= 6.20160923) progress bars
      (note that if content is to be obtained from an archive, no progress
      will be reported yet)
- [install] `--reckless` mode option
- [search]
    - highlights locations and fieldmaps for better readability
    - supports `-d^` or `-d///` to point to top-most or centrally
      installed meta-datasets
    - "complete" paths to the datasets are reported now
    - `-s` option to specify which fields (only) to search
- various enhancements and small fixes to [meta-data] handling, [ls],
  custom remotes, code-base formatting, downloaders, etc
- completely switched to `tqdm` library (`progressbar` is no longer
  used/supported)


## 0.3 (Sep 23, 2016) -- winter is coming

Lots of everything, including but not limited to

- enhanced index viewer, as the one on http://datasets.datalad.org
- initial new data providers support: [Kaggle], [BALSA], [NDA], [NITRC]
- initial [meta-data support and management]
- new and/or improved crawler pipelines for [BALSA], [CRCNS], [OpenfMRI]
- refactored [install] command, now with separate [get]
- some other commands renaming/refactoring (e.g., [create-sibling])
- datalad [search] would give you an option to install datalad's 
  super-dataset under ~/datalad if ran outside of a dataset
