* BlockingIOError wakeup messages

When running some tests (e.g., test_gitrepo.py), the test pass but
there are lots of errors like this

#+begin_quote
  Exception ignored when trying to write to the signal wakeup fd:
  BlockingIOError: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable
#+end_quote

For more information, see [[https://bugs.python.org/issue21595][here]], where it was somewhat mitigated but
not solved.

I've blindly tried various ways of cleaning things up with asyncio,
but haven't been able to stumble onto anything that removes the error.

* parameter interaction

| log_online | log_stdout | log_stderr |   | stdout is | stderr is |
|------------+------------+------------+---+-----------+-----------|
| False      | False      | False      |   | displayed | displayed |
| False      | True       | False      |   | captured  | displayed |
| False      | True       | True       |   | captured  | captured  |
| False      | False      | True       |   | displayed | captured  |
| True       | False      | False      |   | displayed | displayed |
| True       | True       | False      |   | captured  | displayed |
| True       | True       | True       |   | captured  | captured  |
| True       | False      | True       |   | displayed | captured  |

My understanding is that, if log_STREAM is ~True~, the output to the
stream is captured and logged based on ~datalad.log.cmd.outputs~.  If
log_STREAM is a callable, output lines are captured but not logged.
And if log_STREAM is false, lines are written directly to the stream.

~log_online~ influences how the output is processed, but it doesn't
influcence whether the output is captured.  That comes down to
log_STREAM.
