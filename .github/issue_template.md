#### What is the problem?
#### What steps will reproduce the problem?
#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad plugin wtf`)?
#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?
#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
