          # Disabled, because reported annex-version of snapshot can't be
          # properly accounted for by tests and inevitably leads to failure.
          # Essentially, this is because snapshot is in between a commit with
          # a bugfix and the following release. Only makes sense, when
          # snapshot is actually up-to-date with annex source repo, which it
          # currently isn't.
