# This workflow is running types checks using `tox -e typing` you could do locally.
# As type hinting is not yet fully and consistently done through out the project only
# some (randomly) selected files (listed in tox.ini) will be checked.  Feel welcome
# to add extra files to the list there. See https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6884
# for the overall goal/progress towards type hints coverage in DataLad.
