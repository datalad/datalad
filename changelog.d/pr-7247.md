### ðŸš€ Enhancements and New Features

- Support for cloning with annex private mode.
  A new `--reckless private` mode was added to the `clone`, `get` & `install` commands.
  Using private mode will configure the new clone with `annex.private=true`, meaning that the clone won't store any information about itself in the git-annex branch (the branch will still exist and contain information about other clones).
  This mode can be used for temporary clones, where changes are pushed (e.g. back to origin), and the temporary clone is promptly discarded.
  See [https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/cloning_a_repository_privately/](cloning a repository privately).
