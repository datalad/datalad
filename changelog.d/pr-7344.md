### ðŸš€ Enhancements and New Features

- Introduce new config `datalad.ui.interactive` to allow users to overrule detection of interactive sessions.
  Faulty detection could lead to stalling, especially when subprocesses like git-annex special remotes where involved.
  Furthermore, detection now only happens in the top-most datalad process and passes its result down to subprocesses, reducing the cases that need such overruling in the first place.
