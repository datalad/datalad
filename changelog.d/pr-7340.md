### üöÄ Enhancements and New Features

- S3 downloader is now able to use AWS credentials from standard AWS
  configuration sources (`~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.aws/config`, or
  `AWS_*` environmental variables) if DataLad credentials are not
  available. The priority order for choosing credentials (first
  possible will be used) is: DataLad credentials, AWS config,
  anonymous connection. AWS configuration files can also be used to
  set the default region for connections, and the number of attempted
  retries for connection problems. See
  [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
  for details.

### üî© Dependencies

- Deprecated `boto` is replaced with `boto3` (used to handle AWS S3
  downloads). Fixes [#5597](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/5597)

### üè† Internal

- Retry logic for S3 connections is now handed over to Boto3 and its
  standard mode, removing our custom method.
