# Ad-hoc Testing Scripts

This folder contains ad-hoc testing scripts produced to test specific
functionality at some point in time.

**Note:** These scripts are not actively maintained and may not work with
current versions of the codebase. They are kept here for reference and
potential future use.

## Scripts

  the `versions` field in run records with older datalad versions.
