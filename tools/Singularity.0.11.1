#
# This container provides a full Python3-based installation of DataLad
# (http://datalad.org) using DataLad's latest development state at the
# time the container is built.
#
# Changelog
# ---------
# 0.11.1
#  - Update to get a fresh build, also with fixed up git-annex.
#    Starting from this build, we would freeze APT repos, to make
#    build reproducible.  The state of APT repos might be after the release
#    to absorb fixes in other packages such as git-annex-standalone.
# 0.10.2
#  - Update after initial "burn-in" time for 0.10 series
# 0.10.rc5
#  - Pre-release
