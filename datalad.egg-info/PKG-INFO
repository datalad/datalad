# 10000-ft. overview

DataLad's purpose is to make data management and data distribution more accessible.
To do so, it stands on the shoulders of [Git] and [Git-annex] to deliver a
decentralized system for data exchange. This includes automated ingestion of
data from online portals and exposing it in readily usable form as Git(-annex)
repositories - or datasets. However, the actual data storage and permission
management remains with the original data provider(s).

The full documentation is available at http://docs.datalad.org and
http://handbook.datalad.org provides a hands-on crash-course on DataLad.

# Extensions

A number of extensions are available that provide additional functionality for
DataLad. Extensions are separate packages that are to be installed in addition
to DataLad. In order to install DataLad customized for a particular domain, one
can simply install an extension directly, and DataLad itself will be
automatically installed with it. An [annotated list of
extensions](http://handbook.datalad.org/extension_pkgs.html) is available in
the [DataLad handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org).


# Support

The documentation for this project is found here:
http://docs.datalad.org

All bugs, concerns, and enhancement requests for this software can be submitted here:
https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues

If you have a problem or would like to ask a question about how to use DataLad,
please [submit a question to
NeuroStars.org](https://neurostars.org/new-topic?body=-%20Please%20describe%20the%20problem.%0A-%20What%20steps%20will%20reproduce%20the%20problem%3F%0A-%20What%20version%20of%20DataLad%20are%20you%20using%20%28run%20%60datalad%20--version%60%29%3F%20On%20what%20operating%20system%20%28consider%20running%20%60datalad%20plugin%20wtf%60%29%3F%0A-%20Please%20provide%20any%20additional%20information%20below.%0A-%20Have%20you%20had%20any%20luck%20using%20DataLad%20before%3F%20%28Sometimes%20we%20get%20tired%20of%20reading%20bug%20reports%20all%20day%20and%20a%20lil'%20positive%20end%20note%20does%20wonders%29&tags=datalad)
with a `datalad` tag.  NeuroStars.org is a platform similar to StackOverflow
but dedicated to neuroinformatics.

# Installation

## Debian-based systems

On Debian-based systems, we recommend enabling [NeuroDebian], via which we
provide recent releases of DataLad. Once enabled, just do:

    apt-get install datalad

## Gentoo-based systems

On Gentoo-based systems (i.e. all systems whose package manager can parse ebuilds as per the [Package Manager Specification]), we recommend [enabling the ::science overlay], via which we
provide recent releases of DataLad. Once enabled, just run:

    emerge datalad

## Other Linux'es via conda

    conda install -c conda-forge datalad

will install the most recently released version, and release candidates are
available via

    conda install -c conda-forge/label/rc datalad

## Other Linux'es, macOS via pip

Before you install this package, please make sure that you [install a recent
version of git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install).  Afterwards,
install the latest version of `datalad` from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/datalad). It is recommended to use
a dedicated [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io):

    # Create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)
    virtualenv --python=python3 ~/env/datalad
    . ~/env/datalad/bin/activate

    # Install from PyPI
    pip install datalad

By default, installation via pip installs the core functionality of DataLad,
allowing for managing datasets etc.  Additional installation schemes
are available, so you can request enhanced installation via
`pip install datalad[SCHEME]`, where `SCHEME` could be:

- `tests`
     to also install dependencies used by DataLad's battery of unit tests
- `full`
     to install all dependencies.

More details on installation and initial configuration can be found in the
[DataLad Handbook: Installation].
