Subject: comment out msgpack and keyring in setup.py

  msgpack -- for some reason on older systems even if installed
  system-wide from debian package, still attempts to pip install it
  for no good reason afaik

  keyring -- there is older keyring vs newer keyring, keyrings.alt bundle
  Will be prescribed in debian/control
