Datalad development is being performed as part of a US-German collaboration in
computational neuroscience (CRCNS) project "DataGit: converging catalogues,
warehouses, and deployment logistics into a federated 'data distribution'"
(Halchenko_/Hanke_), co-funded by the US National Science Foundation (`NSF
1429999`_) and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (`BMBF
01GQ1411`_).

Datalad is built atop the git-annex_ software that is being developed and
maintained by `Joey Hess`_.
