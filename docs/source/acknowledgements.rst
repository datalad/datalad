DataLad development is being performed as part of a US-German collaboration in
computational neuroscience (CRCNS) project "DataGit: converging catalogues,
warehouses, and deployment logistics into a federated 'data distribution'"
(Halchenko_/Hanke_), co-funded by the US National Science Foundation (`NSF
1429999`_) and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (`BMBF
01GQ1411`_). Additional support is provided by the German federal state of
Saxony-Anhalt and the European Regional Development
Fund (ERDF), Project: `Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences`_, Imaging Platform.
DataLad also received support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG,
German Research Foundation) under grants `SFB 1451 (431549029, INF project)`_
and `CRC 379 (512007073, Q02)`_.

DataLad is built atop the git-annex_ software that is being developed and
maintained by `Joey Hess`_.
