class Flyweight(type):
    """Metaclass providing an implementation of the flyweight pattern.

    Since the flyweight is very similar to a singleton, we occasionally use this
    term to make clear there's only one instance (at a time).
    This integrates the "factory" into the actual classes, which need
    to have a class attribute `_unique_instances` (WeakValueDictionary).
    By providing an implementation of __call__, you don't need to call a
    factory's get_xy_repo() method to get a singleton. Instead this is called
    when you simply instantiate via MyClass(). So, you basically don't even need
    to know there were singletons. Therefore it is also less likely to sabotage
    the concept by not being aware of how to get an appropriate object.

    Multiple instances, pointing to the same physical repository can cause a
    lot of trouble. This is why this class exists. You should be very aware of
    the implications, if you want to circumvent that mechanism.

    To use this pattern, you need to add this class as a metaclass to the class
    you want to use it with. Additionally there needs to be a class attribute
    `_unique_instances`, which should be a `WeakValueDictionary`. Furthermore
    implement `_flyweight_id_from_args` method to determine, what should be the
    identifying criteria to consider two requested instances the same.

    Example:

    from weakref import WeakValueDictionary
    from six import add_metaclass

    @add_metaclass(Flyweight)
    class MyFlyweightClass(object):

        _unique_instances = WeakValueDictionary()

        @classmethod
        def _flyweight_id_from_args(cls, *args, **kwargs):

            id = kwargs.pop('id')
            return id, args, kwargs

        def __init__(self, some, someother=None):
            pass

    a = MyFlyweightClass('bla', id=1)
    b = MyFlyweightClass('blubb', id=1)
    assert a is b
    c = MyFlyweightClass('whatever', id=2)
    assert c is not a

        determine whether or not there already is an instance of that kind and
