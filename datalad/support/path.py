    own parent (haven't you watched Predestination?) ;)

    All paths should be POSIX, relative, and not pointing outside (not starting
    with ../)

    Accent is made on performance to avoid O(len(paths) * len(parents))
    runtime.  ATM should be typically less than O(len(paths) * len(log(parents)))

    Initial intended use - for a list of paths in the repository
    to provide their paths as files/submodules known to that repository, to
    overcome difference in ls-tree and ls-files, where ls-files outputs nothing
    for paths within submodules.
    It is coded, so it could later be applied even whenever there are nested
    parents, e.g. parents = ['sub', 'sub/sub'] and then the "deepest" parent
    is selected

    Parameters
    ----------
    parents: list of str
    paths: list of str
    only_with_parents: bool, optional
      If set to True, return a list of only parent paths where that path had
      a parent

    Returns
    -------
    A list of paths (without duplicates), where some entries replaced with
    their "parents" without duplicates.  So for 'a/b' and 'a/c' with a being
    among parents, there will be a single 'a'
