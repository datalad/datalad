    """Given a list of children paths, return their parent paths among parents
    or their own path if there is no known parent. A path is also considered its
    own parent (haven't you watched Predestination?) ;)

    All paths should be relative, not pointing outside (not starting
    with ../), and normalized (no // or dir/../dir and alike). Only minimal
    sanity checking of values is done.  By default paths are considered to be
    POSIX. Use 'sep' kwarg to set to `os.sep` to provide OS specific handling.

    Accent is made on performance to avoid O(len(paths) * len(parents))
    runtime.  ATM should be typically less than O(len(paths) * len(log(parents)))

    Initial intended use - for a list of paths in the repository
    to provide their paths as files/submodules known to that repository, to
    overcome difference in ls-tree and ls-files, where ls-files outputs nothing
    for paths within submodules.
    It is coded, so it could later be applied even whenever there are nested
    parents, e.g. parents = ['sub', 'sub/sub'] and then the "deepest" parent
    is selected.

    With `return_paths=True` and `only_with_parents=True` this function could
    used to effectively subselect `paths` which have any of the `parents`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    paths: list of str
    parents: list of str
    only_with_parents: bool, optional
      If set to True, return a list of only parent paths where that path had
      a parent
    sep: str, optional
      Path separator.  By default - '/' and thus treating paths as POSIX.
      If you are processing OS-specific paths (for both `parents` and `paths`),
      specify `sep=os.sep`.
    return_paths: bool, optional
      Instead of returning parents, return actual paths which "matched" (or not
      if not only_with_parents) the parents.

    Returns
    -------
    A list of paths (without duplicates), where some entries replaced with
    their "parents" without duplicates.  So for 'a/b' and 'a/c' with 'a' being
    among parents, there will be a single 'a'
