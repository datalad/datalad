def eval_results(func):
    """Decorator for return value evaluation of datalad commands.

    Note, this decorator is only compatible with commands that return
    status dict sequences!

    Two basic modes of operation are supported: 1) "generator mode" that
    `yields` individual results, and 2) "list mode" that returns a sequence of
    results. The behavior can be selected via the kwarg `return_type`.
    Default is "list mode".

    This decorator implements common functionality for result rendering/output,
    error detection/handling, and logging.

    Result rendering/output can be triggered via the
    `datalad.api.result-renderer` configuration variable, or the
    `result_renderer` keyword argument of each decorated command. Supported
    modes are: 'default' (one line per result with action, status, path,
    and an optional message); 'json' (one object per result, like git-annex),
    'tailored' custom output formatting provided by each command
    class (if any).

    Error detection works by inspecting the `status` item of all result
    dictionaries. Any occurrence of a status other than 'ok' or 'notneeded'
    will cause an IncompleteResultsError exception to be raised that carries
    the failed actions' status dictionaries in its `failed` attribute.

    Status messages will be logged automatically, by default the following
    association of result status and log channel will be used: 'ok' (debug),
    'notneeded' (debug), 'impossible' (warning), 'error' (error).  Logger
    instances included in the results are used to capture the origin of a
    status report.
