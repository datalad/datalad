    the given reference dataset since a given state.

    The change set is traced across all related subdatasets, i.e. if a submodule
    in the reference dataset is reported as modified then all paths for any given
    subdataset in the modified one are tested for changes too (based on the
    state at which the parent dataset reports a change in the subdataset), and so
    on.

    In doing so, not only unmodified given paths are removed, but also modified
    given paths are replaced by the set of actually modified paths within them.

    content_by_ds : dict
