    This command is the antagonist of 'get'. It can undo the retrieval of file
    content, and the installation of subdatasets.

    Dropping is a safe-by-default operation. Before dropping any information,
    the command confirms the continued availability of file-content (see e.g.,
    configuration 'annex.numcopies'), and the state of all dataset branches
    from at least one known dataset sibling. Moreover, prior removal of an
    entire dataset annex, that it is confirmed that it is no longer marked
    as existing in the network of dataset siblings.

    Importantly, all checks regarding version history availability and local
    annex availability are performed using the current state of remote
    siblings as known to the local dataset. This is done for performance
    reasons and for resilience in case of absent network connectivity. To
    ensure decision making based on up-to-date information, it is advised to
    execute a dataset update before dropping dataset components.
