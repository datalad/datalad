Git credential interface to DataLad's credential management system.

In order to use this, one needs to configure git to use the credential helper
'datalad'. In the simplest case this can be achieved by 'git config --add
--global credential.helper datalad'. This can be restricted to apply to
certain URLs only. See 'man gitcredentials' and
http://docs.datalad.org/credentials.html for details.

Only DataLad's UserPassword-type credentials are supported. This helper
passes standard 'get', 'store' actions on to the respective interfaces in
DataLad.
The 'erase' action is not supported, since this is called by Git, when the
credentials didn't work for a URL. However, DataLad's providers store a regex
for matching URLs. That regex-credential combo may still be valid and simply
too broad. We wouldn't want to auto-delete in that case. Another case is a
somewhat circular setup: Another credential-helper provided the credentials and
is also used by DataLad. The provider config connecting it to DataLad could be
intentionally broad. Deleting credentials from keyring but keeping the provider
config pointing to them, on the other hand,  would be even worse, as it would
invalidate the provider config and also means rejecting credentials w/o context.
Hence, this helper doesn't do anything on 'erase' at the moment.

usage: git credential-datalad [option] <action>

options:
    -h                   Show this help.

If DataLad's config variable 'datalad.credentials.githelper.noninteractive' is
set: Don't ask for user confirmation when storing to DataLad's credential
system. This may fail if default names result in a conflict with existing ones.
This mode is used for DataLad's CI tests. Note, that this config can not
reliably be read from local configs (a repository's .git/config or
.datalad/config) as this credential helper when called by Git doesn't get to
know what repository it is operating on.
