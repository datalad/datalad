class AggregateMetaData(Interface):
    """Aggregate metadata of one or more datasets for later query.

    Metadata aggregation refers to a procedure that extracts metadata present
    in a dataset into a portable representation that is stored a single
    standardized format. Moreover, metadata aggregation can also extract
    metadata in this format from one dataset and store it in another
    (super)dataset. Based on such collections of aggregated metadata it is
    possible to discover particular datasets and specific parts of their
    content, without having to obtain the target datasets first (see the
    DataLad 'search' command).

    To enable aggregation of metadata that are contained in files of a dataset,
    one has to enable one or more metadata extractor for a dataset. DataLad
    supports a number of common metadata standards, such as the Exchangeable
    Image File Format (EXIF), Adobe's Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP), and
    various audio file metadata systems like ID3. DataLad extension packages
    can provide metadata data extractors for additional metadata sources. For
    example, the neuroimaging extension provides extractors for scientific
    (meta)data standards like BIDS, DICOM, and NIfTI1.  Some metadata
    extractors depend on particular 3rd-party software. The list of metadata
    extractors available to a particular DataLad installation is reported by
    the 'wtf' command ('datalad wtf').

    Enabling a metadata extractor for a dataset is done by adding its name to the
    'datalad.metadata.nativetype' configuration variable -- typically in the
    dataset's configuration file (.datalad/config), e.g.::

      [datalad "metadata"]
        nativetype = exif
        nativetype = xmp

    If an enabled metadata extractor is not available in a particular DataLad
    installation, metadata extraction will not succeed in order to avoid
    inconsistent aggregation results.

    Enabling multiple extractors is supported. In this case, metadata are
    extracted by each extractor individually, and stored alongside each other.
    Metadata aggregation will also extract DataLad's own metadata (extractors
    'datalad_core', and 'annex').

    Metadata aggregation can be performed recursively, in order to aggregate all
    metadata across all subdatasets, for example, to be able to search across
    any content in any dataset of a collection. Aggregation can also be performed
    for subdatasets that are not available locally. In this case, pre-aggregated
    metadata from the closest available superdataset will be considered instead.

    Depending on the versatility of the present metadata and the number of dataset
    or files, aggregated metadata can grow prohibitively large. A number of
    configuration switches are provided to mitigate such issues.

    datalad.metadata.aggregate-content-<extractor-name>
      If set to false, content metadata aggregation will not be performed for
      the named metadata extractor (a potential underscore '_' in the extractor name must
      be replaced by a dash '-'). This can substantially reduce the runtime for
      metadata extraction, and also reduce the size of the generated metadata
      aggregate. Note, however, that some extractors may not produce any metadata
      when this is disabled, because their metadata might come from individual
      file headers only. 'datalad.metadata.store-aggregate-content' might be
      a more appropriate setting in such cases.

    datalad.metadata.aggregate-ignore-fields
      Any metadata key matching any regular expression in this configuration setting
      is removed prior to generating the dataset-level metadata summary (keys
      and their unique values across all dataset content), and from the dataset
      metadata itself. This switch can also be used to filter out sensitive
      information prior aggregation.

    datalad.metadata.generate-unique-<extractor-name>
      If set to false, DataLad will not auto-generate a summary of unique content
      metadata values for a particular extractor as part of the dataset-global metadata
      (a potential underscore '_' in the extractor name must be replaced by a dash '-').
      This can be useful if such a summary is bloated due to minor uninformative (e.g.
      numerical) differences, or when a particular extractor already provides a
      carefully designed content metadata summary.

    datalad.metadata.maxfieldsize
      Any metadata value that exceeds the size threshold given by this configuration
      setting (in bytes/characters) is removed.

    datalad.metadata.store-aggregate-content
      If set, extracted content metadata are still used to generate a dataset-level
      summary of present metadata (all keys and their unique values across all
      files in a dataset are determined and stored as part of the dataset-level
      metadata aggregate, see datalad.metadata.generate-unique-<extractor-name>),
      but metadata on individual files are not stored.
      This switch can be used to avoid prohibitively large metadata files. Discovery
      of datasets containing content matching particular metadata properties will
      still be possible, but such datasets would have to be obtained first in order
      to discover which particular files in them match these properties.
