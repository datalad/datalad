    This is the core data type of DataLad: a representation of a dataset.
    At its core, datasets are (git-annex enabled) Git repositories. This
    class provides all operations that can be performed on a dataset.

    Creating a dataset instance is cheap, all actual operations are
    delayed until they are actually needed. Creating multiple `Dataset`
    class instances for the same Dataset location will automatically
    yield references to the same object.

    A dataset instance comprises of two major components: a `repo`
    attribute, and a `config` attribute. The former offers access to
    low-level functionality of the Git or git-annex repository. The
    latter gives access to a dataset's configuration manager.

    Most functionality is available via methods of this class, but also
    as stand-alone functions with the same name in `datalad.api`.

    This function tries to resolve a dataset given an input argument,

    ----------
    dataset : None or path or Dataset
      Some value identifying a dataset or `None`. In the latter case
      a dataset will be searched based on the process working directory.
    check_installed : bool, optional

    purpose : str, optional
      This string will be inserted in error messages to make them more

def resolve_path(path, ds=None, ds_resolved=None):
    """Resolve a path specification (against a Dataset location)

    Any path is returned as an absolute path. If, and only if, a dataset
    object instance is given as `ds`, relative paths are interpreted as
    relative to the given dataset. In all other cases, relative paths are
    treated as relative to the current working directory.

    Note however, that this function is not able to resolve arbitrarily
    obfuscated path specifications. All operations are purely lexical, and no
    actual path resolution against the filesystem content is performed.
    Consequently, common relative path arguments like '../something' (relative
    to PWD) can be handled properly, but things like 'down/../under' cannot, as
    resolving this path properly depends on the actual target of any
    (potential) symlink leading up to '..'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str or PathLike or list
      Platform-specific path specific path specification. Multiple path
      specifications can be given as a list
    ds : Dataset or PathLike or None
      Dataset instance to resolve relative paths against.
    ds_resolved : Dataset or None
      A dataset instance that was created from `ds` outside can be provided
      to avoid multiple instantiation on repeated calls.

    Returns
    -------
    `pathlib.Path` object or list(Path)
      When a list was given as input a list is returned, a Path instance
      otherwise.
