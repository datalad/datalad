    Typically, files and directories to be added to a dataset would be placed
    into a directory of a dataset, and subsequently this command can be used to
    register this new content with the dataset. With recursion enabled,
    files will be added to their respective subdatasets as well.

    || REFLOW >>
    By default all files are added to the dataset's :term:`annex`, i.e. only
    their content identity and availability information is tracked with Git.
    This results in lightweight datasets. If desired, the [PY: `to_git`
    PY][CMD: --to-git CMD] flag can be used to tell datalad to inject files
    directly into Git. While this is not recommended for binary data or large
    files, it can be used for source code and meta-data to be able to benefit
    from Git's track and merge capabilities. Files checked directly into Git
    are always and unconditionally available immediately after installation of
    a dataset.
