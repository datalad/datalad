    """Install a dataset from a (remote) source.

    This command creates a local :term:`sibling` of an existing dataset from a
    (remote) location identified via a URL or path. Optional recursion into
    potential subdatasets, and download of all referenced data is supported.
    The new dataset can be optionally registered in an existing
    :term:`superdataset` by identifying it via the `dataset` argument (the new
    dataset's path needs to be located within the superdataset for that).

    It is recommended to provide a brief description to label the dataset's
    nature *and* location, e.g. "Michael's music on black laptop". This helps
    humans to identify data locations in distributed scenarios.  By default an
    identifier comprised of user and machine name, plus path will be generated.

    When only partial dataset content shall be obtained, it is recommended to
    use this command without the `get-data` flag, followed by a
    :func:`~datalad.api.get` operation to obtain the desired data.

    .. note::
      Power-user info: This command uses :command:`git clone`, and
      :command:`git annex init` to prepare the dataset. Registering to a
      superdataset is performed via a :command:`git submodule add` operation
      in the discovered superdataset.
