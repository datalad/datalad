        Parameters
        ----------
        cmd : list or str
          Sequence of program arguments. Passing a single string causes
          execution via the platform shell.
        protocol : WitlessProtocol, optional
          Protocol class handling interaction with the running process
          (e.g. output capture). A number of pre-crafted classes are
          provided (e.g `KillOutput`, `NoCapture`, `GitProgress`).
          If the protocol has the GeneratorMixIn-mixin, the run-method
          will return an iterator and can therefore be used in a for-clause.
        stdin : file-like, string, bytes, Queue, or None
          If stdin is a file-like, it will be directly used as stdin for the
          subprocess. The caller is responsible for writing to it and closing it.
          If stdin is a string or bytes, those will be fed to stdin of the
          subprocess. If all data is written, stdin will be closed.
          If stdin is a Queue, all elements (bytes) put into the Queue will
          be passed to stdin until None is read from the queue. If None is read,
          stdin of the subprocess is closed.
        cwd : path-like, optional
          If given, commands are executed with this path as PWD,
          the PWD of the parent process is used otherwise. Overrides
          any `cwd` given to the constructor.
        env : dict, optional
          Environment to be used for command execution. If `cwd`
          was given, 'PWD' in the environment is set to its value.
          This must be a complete environment definition, no values
          from the current environment will be inherited. Overrides
          any `env` given to the constructor.
        timeout:
          None or the seconds after which a timeout callback is
          invoked, if no progress was made in communicating with
          the sub-process, or if waiting for the subprocess exit
          took more than the specified time. See the protocol and
          `ThreadedRunner` descriptions for a more detailed discussion
          on timeouts.
        exception_on_error : bool, optional
          This argument is only interpreted if the protocol is a subclass
          of `GeneratorMixIn`. If it is `True` (default), a
          `CommandErrorException` is raised by the generator if the
          sub process exited with a return code not equal to zero. If the
          parameter is `False`, no exception is raised. In both cases the
          return code can be read from the attribute `return_code` of
          the generator.
        kwargs :
          Passed to the Protocol class constructor.

        Returns
        -------
          Union[Any, Generator]

            If the protocol is not a subclass of `GeneratorMixIn`, the
            result of protocol._prepare_result will be returned.

            If the protocol is a subclass of `GeneratorMixIn`, a Generator
            will be returned. This allows to use this method in constructs like:

                for protocol_output in runner.run():
                    ...

            Where the iterator yields whatever protocol.pipe_data_received
            sends into the generator.
            If all output was yielded and the process has terminated, the
            generator will raise StopIteration(return_code), where
            return_code is the return code of the process. The return code
            of the process will also be stored in the "return_code"-attribute
            of the runner. So you could write:

               gen = runner.run()
               for file_descriptor, data in gen:
                   ...

               # get the return code of the process
               result = gen.return_code

        Raises
        ------
        CommandError
          On execution failure (non-zero exit code) this exception is
          raised which provides the command (cmd), stdout, stderr,
          exit code (status), and a message identifying the failed
          command, as properties.
        FileNotFoundError
          When a given executable does not exist.
